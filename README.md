# Albums

Albums is a cross-platform application that uses iTunes API to fetch the details of a song/artist/album you like... Type in the
name and you'll have the list right there...

Albums is built using the ionic(https://ionicframework.com/) UI templates so it looks and feels like a Native Application... It is 3 way cross platoform 
(i.e iOS, Android, Web)...

It is also integrated with the Firebase real-time database to store all the IDs of your liked songs... Right now the storage 
I've used was public meaning you can see all songs liked worldwide... You can fork this project, ammend changes and tag me (@ppvalluri09)...

This is how the app looks:
